I'm currently a student at CSULB studying Computer Science with ambitions of becoming a Full-Stack Developer. I enjoy coding, teaching others to code, and learning more about it! So for the past year, I have been working as a Code Coach teaching kids aged 8-15 on the basics of programming, data structures, algorithms, and Web Development. It's been an awesome experience getting to share my knowledge and watch the kids get excited about coding. As someone who's always striving to level up my skills, I've also been interning at a few different programs and start-ups to dive deeper into real-world projects. I'm constantly on the lookout for fresh opportunities in the tech sphere where I can keep growing and contributing my skills.
