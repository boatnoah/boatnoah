## 👨🏻‍💻 About me

> I'm currently a student at CSULB studying Computer Science with ambitions of becoming a backend developer. I enjoy coding, teaching others to code, and learning more about it! So for the past year, I have worked as a Code Coach teaching kids aged 8-15 the basics of programming, data structures, algorithms, and web devt. As someone who's always striving to level up my skills, I've also been interned at a few different programs and start-ups to dive deeper into real-world projects. I'm constantly on the lookout for fresh opportunities in the tech sphere where I can keep growing and contributing my skills.
Outside of work, I love playing table tennis, make daily [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@boatnoah), and spending hours configuring my Neovim setup.
